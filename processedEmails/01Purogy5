Subject: RE: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Hi Ning and Harvey,

I got the reply from Purogyr that the engineering samples cannot be round. Therefore we have to keep the size of 250 x 250mm as defined in the original request. I will prepare an short spec for this sampling beginning of next week.

Regards Thomas
