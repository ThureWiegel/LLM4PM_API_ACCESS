Hi Allen,
For this case, please get the quote from Suzhou to Dynovolt.
Delivery can also be from Suzhou directly.

The payment terms and Incoterms should be consistent in my opinion as we are one company.

Toything unclear, please call me.

Thanks very much for your attention.
Best regards,
Benjamin
