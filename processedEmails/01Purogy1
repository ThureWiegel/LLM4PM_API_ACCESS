Dear Thomas,
Cosmetic quality of SEC project is improved by cleaning comparing to other 12inch wafers.
The spec you propose is tighter than SEC project. I think it is possible by sorting and would cause some yield loss.
Square sheet should be with no challenges to cold process and cleaning. Tyvek or paper interleaf could be used as package currently.

Non-contact packaging:  It would be better if customer could accept using 12inch wafer instead of square sheet.

If customer insist on square sheet and non-contact package:
We need to find more sources in market or pay thousands of RMB to suppliers to develop new mould for producing plastic box.
The MOQ would be 50 boxes. There would be some risk of breakage during delivery for 0.65mmT
because the glass format is big and plastic box is not strong enough comparing to RTU or FOSB.
We may need to do some reliable test base on the new developed package.
