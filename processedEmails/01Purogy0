Subject: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Hi Harvey,

Today we had a customer discussion with SK Purogyr about engineering samples they need for development. The need an offer as soon as possible. Therefore I would like to ask you to provide an offer based on below requirements:

Material:             BF33
Size:                      250 x 250 mm
Thickness:           0.65mm
Process:               lapped and polished
Edge:                    Round shape – edge polishing
TTV:                      <=5µm
Warpage:            <=50µm
Cosmetic quality: they requested defect free samples but this is not possible. Therefore we should offer the quality as we produce for e.g. SEC, or do we have chances to improve the quality?
I suggest below definition:
Point defects:    <50µm (if possible)
Scratches:           L: <10mm W: <20µm
                Edge defects:     <100µm
Quantity:            10 pcs.
Packaging:          Wafer boxes?? Contact free?

One question from my side: is that size of 250 x 250mm OK or should we convince the customer to get Ø300mm instead of?
Do you need some mor data?

Thank you very much for your support!
Regards Thomas
