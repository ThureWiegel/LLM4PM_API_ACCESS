Subject: RE: Electrica - new sampling based on 0.5mm material

Dear Thomas,

Thank you for giving us detailed direction for the next sampling

Before we start to discuss for the new sampling details with Electrica, I ask some technical questions and comments with red marking regarding quality properties as below.

Important quality properties

·       Cosmetic quality like scratches, point defects: which S/D Spec we could achieve (40/20 or 20/10??)
->  S/D spec we previously provided to Electrica is 60/40
Q1. Do we need to change the S/D spec from 60/40 to 40/20 or 20/10 for next sampling?

As previously shared the sample inspection result, Electrica does not yet have the required inspection conditions that can inspect the surface quality of panel glass.
So, We can directly check the surface quality with our inspection conditions and also give them our feedback to be more improved before next sampling.

·       TTV, How much is the TTV changing during the etching process
->  If we send the current panel glass sample to ACS as above Q2, TTV level also can be measured by our equipment.

·       Yield of etching: we give 20 pcs. and want to have 20 pcs. back (if they need additional glasses to setup the processes we can also add several pcs. e.g. in 25pcs. out 20pcs.)
-> We will check how many glasses do they need to produce 20pcs sample after internal alignment for sampling details.

Please give us your answers for my questions and comments.

Thank you


Kind regards,
