Subject: RE: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Dear Thomas

Purogyr’s feedback on the quotation of engineering sample with BF33, They add requirement for having comparison sample. Could you help this inquiry ?

1. Reduce quantity to 5 pcs for engineering sample.
2. Add 5 pcs with same spec of BF33 50 pcs sample from Jena. That means 250x250x0.7mm with edge grinding only
   But we need to select glass to meet specification as attached, correct ?

è  Total 10 pcs (5 pcs with surface and edge polished / 5pcs with non-surface polished and edge grinding)


Kind regards,
