Subject: RE: Electrica - new sampling based on 0.5mm material

Hi Johnny,

Thank you for your questions. Please find my answers below:

Toswer Q1:

  *   The initial requirement of S/D 60/40 was a general definition not focused to an application
  *   Now we try to simulate the etching of an Intel panel (which is strictly confidential and may not mentioned to Electrica)
  *   Intel requirement are much more tighter:
     *   Interim quality:                20/10
     *   Final quality:                     10/5
  *   Next sampling need the spec of 20/10

Toswer Q2:

  *   Based on my understanding they are quite professional to handle the displays they etch
  *   Therefore I am confident that they can handle our glasses also professionally
  *   The first tests they did are processed under conditions which are not clear for me. Therefore it is difficult to judge about this quality.
  *   The new sampling we plan will have much more clear definition:
     *   We provide processed glasses with defined quality
     *   Electrica need to etch down the thickness from 0.5mm to 0.25mm
     *   We get back all samples and check their quality under defined conditions.
  *   Therefore it is not necessary to check the existing glasses before.
  *   Yes, we also will measure then the TTV/Warp etc.

Do you have already the quantity of samples they might need additionally?

Regards Thomas
