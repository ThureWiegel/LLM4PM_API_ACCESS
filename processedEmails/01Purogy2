Dear Both,
Would be foil laminated fine for the shipment.

Regarding the spec. please find my comment below.
250*250mm is almost ~14inch.

1.     Warp spec. would be having some yield loss, since 50Âµm is kind of at the spec. boundary for 12inch.

2.     Please offer the R value for the 4 corners.

3.     Thickness tolerance, we will propose +/-10um.


Best Regards,

Ning
