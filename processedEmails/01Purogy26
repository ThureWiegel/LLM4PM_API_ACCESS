Subject: AW: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Hi together,

if ACS is able to provide all samples I would suggest do the sampling at one plant and not involve different plants for this case.
Makes the handling much easier in my opinion and do not confuse the customer too much.

Best regards
David
