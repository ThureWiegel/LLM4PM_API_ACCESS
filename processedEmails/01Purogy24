Subject: RE: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Dear All

Korea team visited Purogyr for September meeting Today. Here is quick updates, AE team will update visit report.

1. First advanced group of Purogyr will move to US in September. The group is consist of 4 engineers including Mr. BY Lee.
Q: will BY joint the meeting on September 20th by person ? How about the other persons that joined the Tech meeting in July (incl. Tothony – he is responsible for R&D)
2. In Purogyr’s experience, Their guess is that edge quality has more influence on separation issue than surface quality, because origin of separation is edge instead of surface, and there is no specific result by each batch/shipment. It happened separation issue randomly and the issue is not observed at lower number of layers like 2 layers each side but it’s observed at higher number of layers like 5 layers.
Q: any info on the symmetry of the layers at top and bottom side ?
3. 2nd 1k pcs shipment will arrive at Purogyr by early of this week, Korea AE team will join the inspection on the shipment, Inspection date will be updated by Purogyr.
Q: very good that Mechlabs AE team will join the inspection ! I propose AE to align with @ Thomas/GRPL/Jena on how best to look onto the samples.
I expecting inspection will be done before Sept 20th visit. Toy pre-info before we go there would help to prepare.
As you remember we plan to report on the improvement measures applied and in future at the meeting anyway. Incl. the quality inspection we should have done in Jena/ GRPL before as well

Comparison 2b + 3: influence of surface quality ?
Purogyr requested adding item 3 with reducing quantity of item 2 to 5 pcs.
--> (Allen’s question) Will we prepare all engineering samples by ACS ? I have not offered FOC for any options. Just checked our idea for adding processing condition.
According to my memory sample 2 will definitely come from ACS. As the sample 2b is a pre-step of making sample 2 I consider also 2b coming from ACS.
For simplicity reason I would suggest also #3 coming from ACS. Unless- as already mentioned – Purogyr insists to get the same edge quality that we are applying to the panels item #1. Means from Jena.
Toy info here ? @ David, Thomas feel free to comment
5. Purogyr starts having monthly Tech-meeting with Apptivia.
Good to know.
