Subject: AW: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Dear all,

the BF samples of #1 are produced this week and sent out from Jena.

The engineering samples #2. 2b and 3 should be prepared asap. We talked about them in our meeting with Purogyr on July 20th, nearly 6 weeks ago.
Thomas: please make final decision together with Uli and provide delivery date asap. I hope, you can discuss the processing of the coupons when you visit Purogyr mid of September. Ideally samples would be there.

I donâ€™t think, we currently meet customer expectation to support them solving a potential showstopper. Tod we have competition, which might be more active.

Thanks and best regards


Jochen
