Subject: RE: Electrica - new sampling based on 0.5mm material

Dear Thomas,

Sorry for the delayed sharing the status of evaluation sample by Electrica.
Please find the summarized status as below.

1. Initial material(BF33 545x540x0.5T, 50pcs) were provided to Electrica with required specifications(attached)
2. Mechlabs Suzhou placed an order for 20pcs evaluation sample to Electrica
3. Sample status
   a) Electrica consumed a total 30pcs for evaluation sample -> 20pcs(Completed whole processing) + 10pcs(Additional glasses for process setting)
    b) Visual inspection result for 20pcs after processing

·            10pcs - OK

·            10pcs – NG -> 7pcs – Dimple(Max size : under 200㎛)/ 2pc – Scratch / 1pc – Edge chip
   c) Thickness/ TTV data
[cid:]

·            Electrica has applied 2steps of final polishing since some of surface defects could be found after 1st polishing. So, they added the 2nd polishing step to remove the surface defects.

·            After slimming, no TTV changed

·            After 1st polishing, AVG 1.4um TTV increased/ 2nd polishing, AVG 4um TTV increased
    d) Sample preparation

·            10pcs are ready to ship to CTSC for re-inspection & evaluation

·            Please note that 7pcs having dimple defects could be OK sample if the spec is S/D 40/20, not 20/10.(Defect images attached)
    e) Remaining stock in Electrica : 20pcs(BF33 545x540x0.5T)

Could you please advise us for the next step? If there is anything to clarify with Electrica, please let me know

Thank you
