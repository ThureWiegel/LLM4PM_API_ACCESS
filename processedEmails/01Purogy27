Subject: RE: Engineering samples for SK Purogyr

Hi All,
Regarding the origin of the samples, I can understand that item #2 and #2b should come from ACS.
However I am of the opinion that items #3 should be from Jena due to the consistent edge grinding.
If we provide another quality level of edge grinding from ACS, we might skew the data.
Just my opinion.
