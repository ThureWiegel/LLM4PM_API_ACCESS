Subject: Electrica - new sampling based on 0.5mm material

Hi both,

Sorry for the delay of my input for this topic. Let me explain the details for this test below:

Goal:


·       Background is the development path BF33, were Jena might be able to develop a glass in spec as floated for mass production

·       Goal is the comparison of cosmetic quality beside the geometrical properties of glass thickness

Initial material

·        as floated in 0.5mm thickness

·       TTV is not important but should be measured and known (5-50µm=ok)

Process flow


·       Transportation to Korea/Electrica

·       Etching and touch polishing at Electrica

·       Evaluation at Electrica

·       Sending back panels to ACS for re-inspection

·       Checking the quality in comparison to the Chinese etching companies we are currently testing

Important quality properties

·       Cosmetic quality like scratches, point defects: which S/D Spec we could achieve (40/20 or 20/10??)

·       TTV, How much is the TTV changing during the etching process

·       Yield of etching: we give 20 pcs. and want to have 20 pcs. back (if they need additional glasses to setup the processes we can also add several pcs. e.g. in 25pcs. out 20pcs.)

Is there any missing point or additional idea from your side for that testing?

If you are fine with the plan above let’s plan the execution of the test. Thank you!
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Best regards / 顺祝商祺
