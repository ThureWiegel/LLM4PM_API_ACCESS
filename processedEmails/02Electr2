Hi Johnny,

Very sorry for the delay of my answer. Tod thank you very much for the summary of the results from Electrica.

Let me summarize the results I understood:
Yield:                    50% according to the specification S/D: 20/10 which is quite tough!
                               100% yield if specification would be 40/20!
Defect types:    Digs and scratches

[Polishing 3  ~11µm][Polishing 1  Reduction?][Polishing 2  ~11µm][Slimming  ~260µm][Cleaning]Process flow:


TTV:                      After Polishing 2: slight increase of average value only (+1.4µm)
                               After Polishing 2: increase of average value (+4µm)

Please find below my questions:

  *   What kind of yield was achieved after the polishing step 2 (please refer to my process flow)?
  *   Are the defects typically caused by the etching process or is there another reason for the defects known?
  *   How did they inspect the sheets (based on an AOI system or by visual inspection)?
  *   Is it possible to further improve the polishing process in order to achieve a higher yield for S/D 20/10?
  *   What polishing time was used for polishing 2 and 3?
  *   How was the quality of the sheets after polishing 1? Did they inspect the glasses before etching?

Next steps:

  *   All 20 pcs. which were processed need to be transferred to ACS in Suzhou.
     *   The plan is to re-inspect the quality based on our methods in order to understand the quality provided from Electrica.
     *   @Ning<mailto: do we have the possibility to evaluate the sheets at your side? I believe we need to clean the sheets before we do our inspection, correct? Let’s discuss how we can do this.
  *   The remaining 20 sheets I would like to process them according to below plan:
     *   10 pcs. Polishing of 15min only
     *   10 pcs. Polishing of 30min only
     *   The idea is to understand the polishing quality of raw materials.
     *   Goals are:           checking of the TTV after polishing 15min and 30min?

Checking of the surface quality after 15min and 30min?
Would you please check the possibility to get this test arranged at Electrica?

Thank you very much for your support! In case of any questions please contact me.

Regards Thomas
