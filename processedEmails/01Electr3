Dear Thomas,

We discussed with Electrica about next sampling with defined details.
Please find the discussion note as below.

  1.  Process flow

  1.  Mechlabs will provide the processed panel glass of BF33 0.5T to Electrica.
  2.  Slimming down to 0.25T and touch polishing needs to be processed in Electrica.
  3.  Electrica requests to check if we can provide panel glass that is a little bigger than the target size. The reason is that cutting, and edge grinding processes are required to remove sharp shaped edge after the slimming process.

Ø  Question1. Can we provide the bigger size of glass? i.e., target size: 515x510/ providing size: 555x550.

Ø  Question2. If so, additional processes (Cut, E/G) need to be done in Electrica after slimming. What is your opinion on that?



  1.  Important quality properties

  1.  Mechlabs informed S/D spec changes and explained S/D definitions.
  2.  Electrica will prepare the required inspection conditions.


  1.  Sampling plan

  1.  Lead time from Electrica: 3~4 weeks
  2.  Electrica needs 30pcs(20pcs : Sample/ 10pcs : Additional test dummy)

Please give the answers on the questions or comments

Thank you
Kind regards,
